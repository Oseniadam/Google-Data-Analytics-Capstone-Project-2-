# How Can a Wellness Company Play It Smart?

For this case study, I am a junior data analyst working with the marketing team for a wellness company called Bellabeat.

A high-tech manufacturer of heath-focused products for women. 

I am looking into current smart device usage trends and how these trends can apply to Bellabeat customers.

The data being used is from FitBit Fitness Tracker, a public dataset available through Mobius (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit). 

My objective is to provide Bellabeat with any information to help with marketing decisions and high-level recommendations.

# Goals
The goals of my analysis are as follows:

Evaluate how customers are using their fitness trackers.

Look into which trends, if any, can apply to Bellabeat customers.

Bring any relevant data to Bellabeat that assists in the marketing of their smart devices.
