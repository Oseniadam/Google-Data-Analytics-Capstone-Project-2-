I am looking into current smart device usage trends and how these trends can apply to Bellabeat customers. \n\nThe data being used is from FitBit Fitness Tracker, a public dataset available through Mobius (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit). My objective is to provide Bellabeat with any information to help with marketing decisions and high-level recommendations. \n\n# **Goals**\n\nThe goals of my analysis are as follows:\n\n1. Evaluate how customers are using their fitness trackers.\n\n2. Look into which trends, if any, can apply to Bellabeat customers.\n\n3. Bring any relevant data to Bellabeat that assists in the marketing of their smart devices. \n\n# **Preparations**\n\nThe data provided has a smaller group of 30 Fitbit users, who have consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes\ninformation about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore usersâ€™ habits. The data was collected between March and May in 2016 and may not be representative of all users given the smaller sampling size. \n\nAfter downloading the dataset from Kaggle, I unzipped and saved the files to a folder on my computer. There were a total of 18 CSV files, but I am choosing to work with the following 6 for analysis.\n\nData is in the form of long data.\n\n* dailyActivity_merged.csv\n* dailyCalories_merged.csv\n* dailyIntensities_merged.csv\n* dailySteps_merged.csv\n* sleepDay_merged.csv\n* weightLogInfo_merged.csv\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"library(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(lubridate)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-12T19:47:08.845366Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-12T19:47:08.84689Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-12T19:47:08.868818Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I began by importing the files needed into R Studio.

Act Phase\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nFrom the data above we can see that:\n\n1. Saturday and Tuesday are the most active days of this group.\n\n2. These FitBit users spent 81% of their time being sedentary.\n\n3. As shown in the graph, the more steps taken by users, the more calories burned, with a few outliers.\n\n\n\n#### Recommendation\n\n1. Since the majority of the time spent wearing the FitBit was without activity (sedentary), I would recomend Bellabeat have notifications or an alert to have user move or get up after a period of time without activity.\n\n2. The most active days are Tuesday and Saturday, so maybe set goals or have rewards for more activity during the stretches in between, maybe at the start of the week to kick off and before the weekend to keep momentum. \n\n3. The users in this group never reached the CDC recommended 10,000 steps a day (the closest being arounf 8000), Bellabeat should make this a priority goal and offer rewards or competitions between users/friends to encourage movement and step targets to be reached.
